6ft or 6ft

This is a game that I thought with the current state of the world and COVID-19.
The idea came up during a grocery shopping trip. It's hard to avoid people when everybody needs to get food.
Grocery stores are obvious collection points.

Thus the game was born. You are going grocery shopping and as you get closer, the density of people increase.
How long can you go until you eventually unwillingly touch another person.

People will stream past you always comming from the top but they can come up from below after they pass you.
Each person will move randomly and can change direction overtime so you need to stay viligent.
People will always try to maintain some distance away from each other.

A funny feature that I thought to add was toilet paper as a diversion.
On your way to get food you can pick up toilet paper and throw them as a diversion to lure people away from you.
This feature highlights the rediculousness of people's need for toilet paper.
They want toilet paper more than they care about touching other people.
